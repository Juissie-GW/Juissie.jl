# ü•ù JUISSIE (JUlIa Semantic Search pIpelinE)

Juissie is a Julia-native semantic query engine. It can be used as a package in software development workflows, or via its desktop user interface.

Juissie was developed as a class project for CSCI 6221: Advanced Software Paradigms at The George Washington University.

## Getting Started

### Quickstart

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate into the cloned repo directory:

```bash
cd Juissie
```

In general, we assume the user is running the `julia` command, and all other commands (e.g., `jupyter notebook`), from the root level of this project.

3. Open the Julia REPL by typing `julia` into the terminal. Then, install the package dependencies:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.resolve()
Pkg.instantiate()
```

To use our generators, you may need an OpenAI API key [see here](#api-keys). To run our demo Jupyter notebooks, you may need to setup Jupyter [see here](#running-jupyter-notebooks).

### Verify Setup

1. From this repo's home directory, open the Julia REPL by typing `julia` into the terminal. Then, try importing the Juissie module:

```julia
using Juissie
```

This should expose symbols like `Corpus`, `Embedder`, `upsert_chunk`, `upsert_document`, `search`, and `embed`.

2. Try instantiating one of the exported struct, like `Corpus`:

```julia
corpus = Corpus()
```

We can test the `upsert` and search functionality associated with `Corpus` like so:

```julia
upsert_chunk(corpus, "Hold me closer, tiny dancer.", "doc1")
upsert_chunk(corpus, "Count the headlights on the highway.", "doc1")
upsert_chunk(corpus, "Lay me down in sheets of linen.", "doc2")
upsert_chunk(corpus, "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. A peck of pickled peppers, Peter Piper picked.", "doc2")
```

Search those chunks:

```julia
idx_list, doc_names, chunks, distances = search(
    corpus, 
    "tiny dancer", 
    2
)
```

The output should look like this:

```bash
([1, 3], ["doc1", "doc2"], ["Hold me closer, tiny dancer.", "Lay me down in sheets of linen."], Vector{Float32}[[5.198073, 9.5337925]])
```

## Usage

### Desktop UI

Navigate to the root directory of this repository (`Juissie.jl`), enter the following into the command line, and press the enter/return key:

```bash
julia src/Frontend.jl
```

This will launch our application:

### Julia Package

Documentation TODO. Walkthroughs of module basic usage may be found in the `notebooks` directory.

## API Keys

Juissie's default generator requires an OpenAI API key. This can be provided manually in the UI (see the `API Key` tab of the Corpus Manager) or passed as an argument when initializing the generator. The preferred method, however, is to [stash your API key in a `.env` file](#managing-api-keys).

### Obtaining an OpenAI API Key

1. Create an OpenAI account [here](https://auth0.openai.com/u/signup).
2. Set up billing information (each query has a small cost) [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods).
3. Create a new secret key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### Managing API Keys

Secure management of secret keys is important. Every user should create a `.env` file in the project root where they add their API key(s), e.g.:
```bash
OAI_KEY=ABC123
```

These may be accessed using Julia via the `DotEnv` library. First, run the `julia` command in a terminal. Then install `DotEnv`:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("DotEnv")
```
Then, use it to access environmental variables from your `.env` file:
```julia
using DotEnv
cfg = DotEnv.config()

api_key = cfg["OAI_KEY"]
```

Note that DotEnv looks for `.env` in the *current* directory, i.e. that of where you called `julia` from. 
If `.env` is in a different path, you have to provide it, e.g. `DotEnv.config(YOUR_PATH_HERE)`. If you are invoking Juissie from the root directory of this repo (typical), this means the `.env` should be placed there.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks

We provide several Jupyter notebooks as demos/walkthroughs of basic usage of the Juissie package. To do so, you may need to complete some preliminary setup:

1. Once Julia is installed, install JupyterLab from the terminal:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
-or-
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Launch a Julia session by typing ```julia``` into the command line, then install `IJulia`:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("IJulia")
exit()
```

3. Launch a Jupyter session from the terminal, where `<notebook>` is the path to the notebook to run:
```bash
jupyter <notebook>
```

4. When you create a new notebook, select a Julia kernel.
