# csci_6221
George Washington University class CSCI 6221 Advanced Software Paradigms: Julia project

## Setup

T0DO. Detailed guides to be added in the `setup` directory.

## Norms

- Code should be documented. I am partial to numpydoc-style docstrings, but those are obviously Python-oriented (though they seem adequate for Julia, too)

## External Dependency/ Libraries

Transformers Julia Package
