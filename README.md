# JUISSIE (JUlIa Semantic Search pIpelinE)

Herein we provide, to our knowledge, the first open source pure-Julia semantic query engine.

## Getting Started

Setup guides can be found in the `guides` directory. For quickstart, see `guides/setup.md`.

Walkthroughs of module basic usage will be added to the `notebooks` directory as needed, as well.

## External Dependencies

We make use of several pre-existing open source Julia packages. These found in `Project.toml`, but we enumerate them here, as well, for convenience:
- Cascadia
- DataFrames
- DotEnv
- Gumbo
- HNSW
- HTTP
- JSON
- LinearAlgebra
- SQLite
- Serialization
- Transformers
- UUIDs
