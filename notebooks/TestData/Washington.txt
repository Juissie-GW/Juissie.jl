President George Washington's Frist Inaugural Address (April 30, 1789) 
President Washington delivered this first inaugural address at Federal Hall, formerly the City 
Hall of New York. He took the oath of office on the balcony before a crowd of spectators and 
then returned inside to the Senate chamber where he delivered this address. When he was 
finished, he and the members of Congress walked to St. Paul's Church for a service. In the 
speech, Washington reflected on the magnitude of the honor and the challenge ahead of him. He 
also sought to define, at this critical moment, the humility and democratic spirit he thought 
proper for the leader of a republic. 
 
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:  
 
Among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than 
that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the 
present month. On the one hand, I was summoned by my Country, whose voice I can never hear 
but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection, 
and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years--a 
retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition 
of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed 
on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of 
my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her 
citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence 
one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil 
administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies. In this conflict of 
emotions all I dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just 
appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is that if, in 
executing this task, I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former 
instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my 
fellow-citizens, and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for 
the weighty and untried cares before me, my error will be palliated by the motives which mislead 
me, and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which 
they originated.  
 
Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to 
the present station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent 
supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of 
nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that His benediction may 
consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a Government 
instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed 
in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this 
homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses 
your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow- citizens at large less than either. 
No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs 
of men more than those of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the
