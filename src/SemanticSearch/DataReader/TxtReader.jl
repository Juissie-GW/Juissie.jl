"""
A simple script that allows a user to split a large file into multiple smaller files. 
This will create splits # of children files, each with a file size ~1/splits 
of the origional target file.

Parameters
----------
fileToSplit : String
    The name of the file to read and split into multiple parts.
    If an absolute file path is given then that will be
    used. Otherwise, relative file paths are evaluated from the location that
    the `julia` command was run from (typically the root level of this project)
outputFileNameBase : String
    The template for the name of the children split-out files. 
    Each split out file with have the format of <outputFileNameBase>_<#> 
    where # starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each subsequent file. 
    There will be `splits` number of children files
splits : Int
    How many children files should be created?

"""
Open the provided filename, load all the data into memory, and return.
This function will also manage the file socket open(...) close(...) properly.
If there was an error in opening or reading the file then the empty 
string will be returned

Parameters
----------
filename: String
    The name of the file to open. Relative file paths are evaluated from
    the directory where the `julia` command was run. Typically the root level
    of the project

Returns: String
    The entire contets of the file, or an empty string if there was an issue

"""
Append the given `contents` into a file specified at `filename`.
A new file will be created if `filename` doesn't already exist.

NOTE: No '\n' newline character will be appended. It is the 
caller's responsibility to decide if the `contents` should have a
'\n' newline character or not. 

Parameters
---------
filename: String
    The name of the file to open. Relative file paths are evaluated from
    the directory where the `julia` command was run. Typically the root level
    of the project
contents: String
    The exact text to append into the file.
