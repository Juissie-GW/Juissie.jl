# csci_6221
George Washington University class CSCI 6221 Advanced Software Paradigms: Julia project

## Getting Started

Guides will be added in the `setup` directory as needed.

Walkthroughs of module basic usage will be added to the `notebooks` directory as needed, as well.

## Norms

- Code should be documented. I am partial to numpydoc-style docstrings, but those are obviously Python-oriented (though they seem adequate for Julia, too)

## External Dependency/ Libraries

Transformers Julia Package
