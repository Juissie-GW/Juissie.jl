      "[131]  Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical  proofs :  enthymeme  (proof by  syllogism ) and  paradeigma  (proof by example). [132] Aristotle writes in his  Poetics  that  epic poetry , tragedy, comedy,  dithyrambic poetry , painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of  mimesis  (\"imitation\"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. [133] [134]  He applies the term  mimesis  both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention [133]  and contends that the audience's realisation of the  mimesis  is vital to understanding the work itself. [133]  Aristotle states that  mimesis  is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals [133] [135]  and that all human artistry \"follows the pattern of nature\". [133]  Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what  Stephen Halliwell  calls \"highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.\" [136]  For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. [137] While it is believed that Aristotle's  Poetics  originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. [139]  The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the  catharsis  of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes  Poetics  with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis.\n"

      "Anaxagoras and Empedocles both delved into the fundamental elements of the cosmos, but their approaches and philosophies diverged significantly. Anaxagoras, hailing from Clazomenae, introduced the concept of \"everything-in-everything\" and attributed the cosmos' creation to \"nous,\" or intellect. He was renowned for explaining eclipses and posited radical scientific theories about celestial bodies. In contrast, Empedocles, a native of Acragas in Sicily, championed a four-part theory of roots (earth, water, air, fire) and incorporated the forces of Love and Strife into his cosmology. While Empedocles' view on Love and Strife was more intricate, involving both mixing and separating, Anaxagoras focused on the dynamic motion of ingredients to form the diverse material world we observe. Furthermore, Empedocles' philosophical musings intertwined with mysticism, religion, and medicine, placing him at the crossroads of myth and reason, while Anaxagoras paved the way for a scientific understanding of the universe through his intellectual pursuits.[507, 157, 159, 160, 266, 179, 509, 169, 206, 158]\n"
