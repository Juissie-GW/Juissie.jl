# csci_6221
George Washington University class CSCI 6221 Advanced Software Paradigms: Julia project

## Getting Started

Setup guides can be found in the `guides` directory. For quickstart, see `guides/setup.md`.

Walkthroughs of module basic usage will be added to the `notebooks` directory as needed, as well.

## Norms

- Code should be documented. I am partial to numpydoc-style docstrings, but those are obviously Python-oriented (though they seem adequate for Julia, too)

## External Dependency/ Libraries

Transformers Julia Package
